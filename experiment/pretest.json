      "question": "What is the primary purpose of SQL Injection?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To optimize database queries",
        "b": "To retrieve data securely",
        "c": "To manipulate databases through malicious input",
        "d": "To test database performance"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "SQL Injection is not about optimization.",
        "b": "SQL Injection is not a secure retrieval method.",
        "c": "Correct! SQL Injection manipulates databases using malicious inputs. Learn more <a href='https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection'>here</a>.",

      "question": "Which payload can exploit an SQL Injection vulnerability?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "' OR 1=1 --",

        "d": "' DROP TABLE users; --"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! This payload always evaluates to true and exploits the vulnerability.",
        "b": "This payload might fail depending on the database structure.",
        "c": "This payload extracts data but does not always exploit authentication.",
        "d": "This payload deletes data but is not commonly used to bypass authentication."

      "question": "What does the term 'parameterized query' mean?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "A query that uses input validation",
        "b": "A query that uses placeholders for input values",
        "c": "A query that combines user input with SQL statements",
        "d": "A query that retrieves all database records"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Input validation is a separate process.",
        "b": "Correct! Parameterized queries use placeholders to prevent SQL Injection.",
        "c": "Directly combining input with SQL increases vulnerability.",
        "d": "Parameterized queries are not designed to retrieve all records."
