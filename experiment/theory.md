SQL Injection (SQLi) is a code injection technique where malicious SQL queries are inserted into input fields, aiming to manipulate a web applicationâ€™s database. This section explains the foundational theory behind SQL injection, its mechanisms, and its implications, providing students with the necessary context for the simulation.

#####  Understanding SQL and SQL Injection
Structured Query Language (SQL) is used to interact with databases, performing tasks such as retrieving, updating, and deleting data. Web applications often use SQL queries to authenticate users, fetch records, or process data.

SQL Injection exploits improperly sanitized inputs in SQL queries. When user input is directly embedded into a query without proper validation or parameterization, attackers can alter the query's logic, leading to unintended behavior. 

#####  Consequences of SQL Injection
SQL Injection can have severe repercussions, including:
Unauthorized Access: Attackers can bypass authentication mechanisms.
Data Exfiltration: Sensitive information like user credentials, financial data, or personal records can be stolen.
Data Manipulation: Attackers can modify or delete records, potentially disrupting operations.
Privilege Escalation: SQL Injection can be used to execute administrative commands, compromising the entire system.
