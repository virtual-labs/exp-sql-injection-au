        "a": "Using prepared statements",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! Prepared statements separate SQL code from input, preventing SQL Injection.",
        "b": "Allowing direct input increases vulnerability.",
        "c": "Hardcoding queries does not address SQL Injection risks.",

      "question": "What is Blind SQL Injection?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "A technique that extracts data using visible outputs",
        "b": "A technique that infers information based on application behavior",
        "c": "A method to drop tables in a database",
        "d": "A process that disables SQL queries"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Blind SQL Injection relies on behavior, not visible outputs.",
        "b": "Correct! Blind SQL Injection infers information through behavior.",
        "c": "This describes a destructive action, not Blind SQL Injection.",

      "question": "Why is input validation important in SQL security?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To reduce query execution time",
        "b": "To restrict unauthorized access",
        "c": "To allow unrestricted user input",
        "d": "To improve database indexing"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Input validation is not focused on execution time.",
        "b": "Correct! Input validation helps restrict unauthorized access by ensuring inputs are safe.",
        "c": "Unrestricted input increases security risks.",
        "d": "Input validation is unrelated to indexing."
