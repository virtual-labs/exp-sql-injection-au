      "question": "Which practice is effective in preventing SQL Injection?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Using prepared statements",
        "b": "Allowing direct user input in SQL queries",
        "c": "Hardcoding all SQL queries",
        "d": "Disabling user authentication"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! Prepared statements separate SQL code from input, preventing SQL Injection.",
        "b": "Allowing direct input increases vulnerability.",
        "c": "Hardcoding queries does not address SQL Injection risks.",
        "d": "Disabling authentication is not a secure practice."

      "question": "What is Blind SQL Injection?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "A technique that extracts data using visible outputs",
        "b": "A technique that infers information based on application behavior",
        "c": "A method to drop tables in a database",
        "d": "A process that disables SQL queries"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Blind SQL Injection relies on behavior, not visible outputs.",
        "b": "Correct! Blind SQL Injection infers information through behavior.",
        "c": "This describes a destructive action, not Blind SQL Injection.",
        "d": "Blind SQL Injection does not disable SQL queries."

    {
      "question": "Why is input validation important in SQL security?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To reduce query execution time",
        "b": "To restrict unauthorized access",
        "c": "To allow unrestricted user input",
        "d": "To improve database indexing"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Input validation is not focused on execution time.",
        "b": "Correct! Input validation helps restrict unauthorized access by ensuring inputs are safe.",
        "c": "Unrestricted input increases security risks.",
        "d": "Input validation is unrelated to indexing."

    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of using a whitelist for input validation?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To allow all input data without restrictions",
        "b": "To define acceptable input values and reject the rest",
        "c": "To automatically sanitize input without user control",
        "d": "To log all user inputs for future analysis"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Allowing all inputs can lead to vulnerabilities.",
        "b": "Correct! A whitelist ensures only acceptable inputs are accepted.",
        "c": "Sanitization alone is not as secure as input whitelisting.",
        "d": "Logging user input does not secure the application."

      "question": "Which SQL command can be used to check for the presence of SQL Injection vulnerabilities?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' AND password = '' OR 1=1 --",
        "b": "INSERT INTO users VALUES ('test', 'password');",

        "d": "UPDATE users SET password = 'newpassword' WHERE username = 'admin';"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! This query shows an example of SQL Injection used to bypass authentication.",
        "b": "This query is an insert statement and not an injection test.",
        "c": "This query deletes data and is not used to test SQL Injection.",
        "d": "This query updates data, not for testing vulnerabilities."

      "question": "What does the '--' in an SQL Injection query represent?",

        "a": "A placeholder for user input",
        "b": "The start of a comment in SQL",
        "c": "An operator for equality comparison",
        "d": "A delimiter for separating commands"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "This is incorrect. '--' does not represent user input.",
        "b": "Correct! '--' is used to start a comment in SQL and can ignore the rest of the query.",
        "c": "This is incorrect. '--' is not used for comparison.",
        "d": "This is incorrect. '--' does not separate commands in SQL."
